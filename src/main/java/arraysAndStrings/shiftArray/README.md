# Exercise description
Write a function that will shift elements in an array to the left.

Function should take two parameters - the array and number of shifts that should be done.

For example:

Array a is equal to {7, 5, 2, 1, 4} and should be shifted two places to the left.

So the outcome array would look like this:

{2, 1, 4, 7, 5}
